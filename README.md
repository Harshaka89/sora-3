üìã Restaurant Reservation System ‚Äì Master Development Guideline



A. Planning & Foundation
A1. Make a complete list of all required features/pages:
Dashboard, All Reservations Table, Calendar/Weekly View, Table Schedule, Tables Management, Operating Hours, Locations, Coupons, Analytics, Settings

 A2. Write out workflows, user journeys, data/fields for each page.
 A3. Set up project folders:
 ‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉ/controllers/, /models/, /views/admin/, /assets/css/, /assets/js/
 A4. Prepare/check all needed database tables (reservations, tables, operating_hours, settings, locations, coupons, analytics)
 A5. Insert test data for development.


B. Admin Menu & Navigation
B1. Add a main plugin menu in WP admin, plus submenu items for:
Dashboard, All Reservations, Weekly View, Table Schedule, Tables, Hours, Locations, Coupons, Analytics, Settings
 B2. Link each menu item to its own /views/admin/ view file.
 B3. Verify navigation works across all admin pages.


C. Modular Styling and Scripts
C1. Place all admin CSS in /assets/css/ by section as needed.
 C2. Place any needed JS in /assets/js/.
 C3. Enqueue CSS/JS only on plugin admin pages via standard WP method.
 C4. Never use <style> or <script> tags in PHP views.
 C5. Test changes in .css/.js files show live in admin instantly.


D. Page-by-Page Implementation
For each admin page:
D0. Make or edit the PHP view file in /views/admin/


D1. Fetch and display the right data from models (DB)


D2. Style exclusively via .css files


D3. Test layout, data, and navigation after each change

D1. Dashboard Page
D1a. Show summary stats (total reservations, covers, revenue, tables, locations, etc.)
 D1b. Add action buttons (add booking, go to calendar, reports, etc.)
 D1c. Confirm stats accuracy.

D2. All Reservations Page
D2a. Modern table with sorted/filterable reservations
 D2b. Status badges/colors, action buttons (view/edit/delete)
 D2c. Ready for advanced search or export as a future enhancement

D3. Calendar / Weekly View Page (This is your ‚Äúweekly view‚Äù‚Äîensure it‚Äôs modern, color-coded, fully connected to DB, and touch/tablet ready)
D3a. Mobile/tablet-friendly grid, color-encoded by status
 D3b. Fast week, day, and table navigation
 D3c. All reservations displayed in correct slots
 D3d. Integrated with time slot logic, table capacity, operating hours

D4. Table Schedule View
D4a. Display each table‚Äôs availability (all days/times)
 D4b. Action links to assign/edit reservations on schedule
D5. Settings Page (WP Settings API)

D5a. Register all fields in controller: business info, email, phone, currency, max party size, policies, etc.
 D5b. View file uses settings_fields()/do_settings_sections()
 D5c. Confirm all fields save, appear, and are used in every relevant feature

D6. Operating Hours Page
D6a. Admin UI to set open/close/break/closed (per day)
 D6b. Save to DB/model; calendar time slot logic always uses operating hours data
 D6c. Add exceptions/holidays, optional

D7. Tables Management Page
D7a. Add/edit/delete tables, assign capacity, zone, and active status
 D7b. Integrate table data with reservations and analytics

D8. Locations Page
D8a. Add/edit/delete restaurant locations/branches
 D8b. Assign location to reservations, tables, hours; use location as admin and analytics filter

D9. Coupons/Promotions Page
D9a. List/add/edit/deactivate coupon codes
 D9b. Set coupon code, discount, expiry, minimum spend, etc.
 D9c. Ensure coupons work in reservation form and appear in analytics

D10. Analytics Page
D10a. Show charts/graphs: bookings per day/time/table/location, covers, revenue, coupon use
 D10b. Filter analytics by time, source, location, table, coupon
 D10c. Add export option if needed

D11. Time Slot Logic (for Calendar/Public Booking)
D11a. Read operating hours and breaks to generate time slots per day
 D11b. Exclude busy slots (already-booked, full capacity, holidays)
 D11c. Filter and display slots based on party size, tables, and reservation status
 D11d. AJAX endpoint for slot checking (for fast admin/public use)

E. Testing & Quality Assurance
E1. After every new page/feature:
Test navigation, data save/load, design


Check all fields/settings, responsiveness, mobile/tablet usability
 E2. Make a change in each CSS/JS asset, confirm instant effect
 E3. Get admin/staff/user feedback, note improvements for next phase


F. Expansion & Advanced Features (After Foundation)
F1. Drag-and-drop in calendar/schedule pages
 F2. Advanced filtering, reporting, and analytics export
 F3. Notifications (email/SMS), reminders to guests/staff
 F4. Guest-facing booking screens, PWA/mobile support, payment integration
 F5. Accessibility and GDPR audit
 
G. Ongoing Maintenance & Documentation
G1. Document each new page/file/field in your project doc
 G2. Back up plugin and database after any major working milestone
 G3. Always build/expand in small, testable steps. Never overwrite working code.
How to Use This Document:
Take each bold lettered/numbered section as its own ‚Äúmini project‚Äù‚ÄîDO NOT skip any main or sub-step.


For future features/expansion, always return to this step document and proceed to the next logical letter/number.


Any time a new admin page/feature is added, repeat steps D0‚ÄìD3, always referencing and expanding this master list.


If you need a focused step-list or QA plan for any specific D-page (like Locations, Coupons, Analytics, Table Schedule, Weekly View, or Time Slots), just say the step and I‚Äôll provide a zoomed-in, non-coding checklist ready for action!
